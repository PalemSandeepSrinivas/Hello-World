    "text = \"I recently went on an amazing vacation to Spain. I was staying in a casa rural, which was a charming little house in the countryside. One evening, I went to a local tapas bar and tried to order some food. I wanted to ask for 'patatas bravas' but I couldn't remember the words. I ended up saying, 'Pah-tah-tahs brah-vahs, por favor.' The bartender laughed and said, 'Muy bien, se√±or.' I felt so proud of myself for trying! I also had some 'pan con tomate,' which I pronounced as 'pahn kohn toh-mah-teh.' It was delicious! Throughout my trip, I kept hearing phrases like 'Ola, como estas?' (Oh-la, koh-moh eh-stahs?) and 'Gracias' (Grah-thee-ahs). I even tried to say 'De nada' (Deh nah-dah) a few times. Overall, it was a fantastic trip, even though my Spanish was limited to phonetic pronunciations!\"\n",
